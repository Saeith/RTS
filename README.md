# RTS Game

RTS game built with Unity3d

## Tech
Unity 2018.2.x  
RTS Engine

## Dev setup / pushing your work
For general questions on how to use Git, I've found [Git's public docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) are very helpful. 

First step is to clone the repo so you have a local repository to work on.

```
git clone https://github.com/RTS-Game/RTS.git
```
**Note:** The clone command copies the repository into your working directory, so make sure to keep track of where you clone it. Once you've cloned the repo locally you can import it into Unity.

From the Unity start menu, the first time you import from your local repository you will have to create a new project and set the location to where you cloned the repo. Once you load the repo once, you should be able to see it under the **Projects** tab in the start menu. Any changes you make will need to be saved locally first (File -> Save Scenes) before you push to the Github repo.   

```
git add "changed_file_1" "changed_file_2" ...
git commit -m "summary of what changes you made"
git push
```

**Note:** In the first line, naming each individual file you changed can be tedious, so you can also use
```
git add .
```
